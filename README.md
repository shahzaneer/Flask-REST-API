# Flask-REST-API-
A minimal Example of Flask REST API building with MySQL database with JWT Auth for Authorization and Authentication

- I have used MySQL as the Database to make rest apis end points
- JWTAuth is integrated for Authentication and Authorization
- Used Model - Controller Architecture to curate the backend logic
